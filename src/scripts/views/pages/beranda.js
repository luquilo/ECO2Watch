                <p>Carbon emissions, mainly carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚), are released into the atmosphere from human activities like burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and agriculture. These emissions significantly contribute to global warming and climate change by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Understanding and managing your carbon footprint is crucial in the fight against climate change.</p>
